Description: A universal tool for interpreting functional characteristics of omics data.
    It supports Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for both coding and non-coding genomics data of thousands of species.
    It provides a unified and tidy interface to access, manipulate, and visualize enrichment results.
    A key capability is the simultaneous analysis and comparison of datasets from multiple treatments or time points.
    Furthermore, it integrates Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to provide automated and insightful interpretation of enrichment results.
