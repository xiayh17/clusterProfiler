Description: This package supports functional characteristics of both coding and non-coding genomics data for thousands of species with up-to-date gene annotation. 
    It provides a universal interface for gene functional annotation from a variety of sources and thus can be applied in diverse scenarios. 
    It provides a tidy interface to access, manipulate, and visualize enrichment results to help users achieve efficient data interpretation. 
    Datasets obtained from multiple treatments and time points can be analyzed and compared in a single run, easily revealing functional consensus 
    and differences among distinct gene clusters.
